			<h2>Reporting Harassment</h2>
			<div class="l__half">
				<p>
					If you are being harassed by a member, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the administrators by typing /admin in Slack, or contact an admin directly via DM. If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.
				</p>
				<p>
					In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="l__half">
				<p>
					We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.
