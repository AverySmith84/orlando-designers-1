Ready to level up your career? 

Come out to hear from Orlando natives, Freelance Illustrator Shauna Lynn Panczyszyn and Remote Dev at Microsoft David Khourshid, speak about their journey to get into their current positions.

These talks are sure to inspire you to push forward in your career path and will provide an opportunity to ask local mentors questions about how they were able to get to where they are today.
