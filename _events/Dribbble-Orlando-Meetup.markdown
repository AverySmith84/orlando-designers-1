**Join us Thursday, August 3rd @ 6:30PM** and learn how to get started with designing and preparing your files for making your own lapel pins with **Hillary and Cristian.** 

Hillary is a freelance Illustrator, winner of the Best in Show award at the 2017 AIGA Orlando SPOT Showcase. Cristian freelances as a designer who has previously worked with UCF Athletics and Orlando City Soccer. They both bring their experience producing lapel pins, coins, and patches for a local company to this talk.

**CREDO Conduit** is a curated cross-disciplinary co-working space focused on convening Central Floridaâ€™s creative class to cultivate a network of meaning, impact and community.

Refreshments will be provided. Courtesy of our friends at **TEKSystems**
