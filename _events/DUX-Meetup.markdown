The desirability of users is typically what people focus on when you hear “UX”. But is that the whole picture? What if we took more into consideration? 

Feasibility, Viability and Desirability work together to formulate all successful products. Let’s talk about the formula and how to leverage it to build out your own product. 

Jean Kaluza will be presenting on the 3 Pillars of Product, giving us a larger perspective in developing products. 

In addition to this presentation we will also be announcing the next big program for the Downtown UX Meetup and what our agenda for the coming months will focus on.
