This month our speaker will be the renowned Everett McKay.

Having an intuitive UI is a top goal for every design project, yet surprisingly few people have a strong understanding of what this concept really means. Designers are no different. (A quick test: ask some designers to define it. Most likely you wonâ€™t be impressed by their answers.)

Food and beverages, as always, are provided by our friends at TEK Systems.
