Ethics is an interesting topic when it comes to most careers, but especially in the world of UX Design. Persuasive design, accessibility, addictive patterns, and even just the types of products we make can often play in gray territories. 

Gus Hernandez, Tommy Hung, and Matt Lavoie will come together to discuss these topics and many others as we open this discussion about Ethics and UX in our community.
