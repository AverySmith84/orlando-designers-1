Join us Monday, April 10 for an evening with Randy Hunt, VP of Design at Etsy and UCF graphic design class of 2005!

We can make anything. What will we make?

We’re a creative species. It’s what has kept us alive and allowed us to invent some pretty amazing things. We’ve also created a pretty complex world with complex demands. The need for design – especially design that emphasizes the humane – is unprecedented. Setting his perspective in historical and contemporary contexts, Etsy's VP Design Randy J. Hunt will look at the modern designer’s opportunity and responsibility.
