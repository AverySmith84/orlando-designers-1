All are invited to our monthly Community Meetingsâ€”AIGA members, non-members, designers, non-designers, and beyond. There's no better way to see what's going on in the Orlando creative community, get involved, and participate in shaping the chapter's growth. 

This is our chapter, it is what we make of it.
