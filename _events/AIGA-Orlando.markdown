The Orlando creative community is what we make of it, and together we're making it thrive. Join us Tuesday, June 6 at The Iron Yard to celebrate the conclusion of another amazing programming year. TEKsystems will be providing pizza and beer, so let's party! 

Everyone is invitedâ€”AIGA members, non-members, designers, non-designers, and beyond. If you have a desire to see our community grow and flourish then we urge you to join us. Whether you're new to the area, new to AIGA, ready to get involved or just curious about what's going on in the Orlando creative community, this monthly meeting is a great place to be.
