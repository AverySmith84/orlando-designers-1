AIGA Orlando's annual SPOT event is back!

This is the capstone exhibition for our 2017 Mentorship Program. Over the past 6 months, design students from around the city have worked closely with local professionals to create a self promotional project. Join us for the showcase of their diligence and talent. Plus, be inspired by our keynote speaker for the evening, Mike Jones. La Empanada will also be there selling food during the event! All ticket sale proceeds will be donated to Feeding Children Everywhere.
