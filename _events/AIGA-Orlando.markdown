All are invited to our Monthly Community Meetingsâ€”AIGA members, non-members, designers, non-designers, and beyond. There's no better way to see what's going on in the Orlando creative community, get involved, and participate in shaping the chapter's growth. See you then!

This is our chapter, it is what we make of it.

NOTE! We are at a new location this month at Credo Conduit!

While this event is free, please register (with Eventbrite) so we can notify you of any changes to this event. Thank you!
