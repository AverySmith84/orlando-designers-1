Just about two years ago [we had a meetup focusing on UX Research](https://www.meetup.com/Downtown-UX-Meetup/events/222311458/). Well, the time has come to see whats new, what's the same, and remind ourselves of the research techniques we can apply in our work today.

This meetup will be interactive but lean more towards a presentation style. Were looking forward to continuing the discussion at the SUX meetup afterwards so please join if you can!
