MOMENTUM is a program of civic problem solving, bringing together creative thinkers (this means you!) from Orlando's non-profit, business, and tech communities to work together over the span of two weeks with a laser-focused goal of creating break-through, high-impact solutions for community organizations that are making a difference in Orlando today.
