Did you know a recent study by Wallethub ranks Orlando  #1 for Gaming Environment and #2 for Gamer and Developer Opportunities?  We'll dive into how Orlando's AR/VR and Gaming is on the front lines of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and what that means for how we visualize our world, tell stories about it, how we work and play in it now and in the future.


Our panel includes, David Glass, Founder and  Executive Producer, OrlandoiX and iSummit, Kunal Patel, Founder of Indienomicon and BrandVR,  and Mike Young, Lead 3D modeler and developer, Megatonn3D .
