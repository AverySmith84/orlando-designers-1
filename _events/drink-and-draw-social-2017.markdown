Here's how this is works. You bring your drawing skills, design knowledge and creativity, and we supply a rousing game of "design nerd" Pictionary. Put it all together for a fun night of drinking, drawing and world class people. Everyone is welcome to play or just come and mingle, whatever you fancy. Bring a friend or 5!

Drinks specials for attendees include $3 assorted craft cans, $1 off wines, and free peanuts! SwedeDISH food truck will also be there selling their authentic Swedish cuisine. 

This event is FREE!
